// axios.get(url[, config])
// axios.get() and axios.post()
// The get() method requires two parameters to be supplied to it. 
// First, it needs the URI of the service endpoint. 
// Second, it should be passed an object that contains the properties we want to send to our server.

// Once an HTTP request is made, Axios returns a promise that is either fulfilled or rejected, 
// depending on the response from the backend service.
// If the promise is fulfilled, the first argument of then() will be called; if the promise is rejected, the second argument will be called.
